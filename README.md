Wifi Bruteforce (WiBr) is a wifi cracking tool writen in c#. Unlike other wireless crackers namely aircrack-ng WiBr simply tries   connecting over and over again each time with a diffrent password (dictionary attack) it is much slower than using tools such as aircrack-ng but is much easier to use.  
### Usage:
1. Select the Wifi Access Point you want to attempt to crack  
2. Select a wordlist (Wordlists can be found [Here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords))  
3. (Optional) Change the connection check delay  
4. Press crack and wait!
