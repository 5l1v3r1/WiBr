<h1 align="center">Wifi Bruteforce</h1>  
Wifi Bruteforce (WiBr) is a wifi cracking tool writen in c#. Unlike other wireless crackers namely aircrack-ng WiBr simply tries   connecting over and over again each time with a diffrent password (dictionary attack) it is much slower than using tools such as aircrack-ng but is much easier to use.
