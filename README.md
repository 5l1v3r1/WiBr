# WiBr
C# Wifi Hacker
  
Wifi Bruteforce (WiBr) is a wifi cracking tool writen in c#.  
Unlike other wireless crackers namely aircrack-ng WiBr simply  
tries connecting over and over again each time with a diffrent  
password (dictionary attack) it is much slower than using   
tools such as aircrack-ng but is much easier to use.
